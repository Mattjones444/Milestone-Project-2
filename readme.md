# Purpose

This project is a website aimed at creating a fun and engaging 'Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire' style game for children to teach them their
three times table called [Who Wants to Be a Times Table
Millionaire](
\*\*\<[[https://mattjones444.github.io/Code-Institute/]{.underline}](https://mattjones444.github.io/Code-Institute/)\>index.html\*\*).

The core purposes of the website:

- introduce the three times table to children.

- teach children the multiplication facts from the three times table..

- Build the children's confidence in learning the three times table.

## Design

As Who Wants to be a Times table Millionaire is a product and service,
the web-page design shapes future brand recognition and styling. The
project's design springs from the ethos and values of Who Wants to be a
Millionaire, it is professional, engaging and fun, aiming to give
players the feeling that they will enjoy a new twist on a format that is
familiar to them. It also seeks to reassure the player that there is a
learning element to the game.

### Colour Scheme

![Palette](/assets/readme/colour-palette.png)

The conventional, modern, solid colour palette choice serves to engender
trust, academia and professionalism, whilst maintaining a modern feel.

#### Dark, Navy Blue

represent a strong background color to contrast with the other elements
on the page.

#### Double Spanish White

Golden color used for the badge and hover elements, gives the user the
impression of a quality product.

#### Sea Grape

Give the user the shadow/auror effect around the badge, creating depth
on the homescreen.

#### Alice Blue

Used for fonts, designed to contrast against the other darker colours.

[### Typography]

[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was chosen for body
text as it is light and easy to read.

### Images

The images in this project were sourced from
[Google.com]([[https://www.google.co.uk](https://www.google.co.uk))
using a search that included images free to use with no rights
restrictions. They were specifically selected to correlate with the main
website colour palette and increase the aesthetic impact of the design.

### Visual Effects

#### Shadows

As the Home Page consists of multiple colourful overlapping blocks, it
was important to add volume and make the content easier to perceive so
the viewer's eye doesn't have to focus on understanding spatial
relationships between elements, which might be daunting. However, to
provide better performance on mobile devices, it was implemented only
for screens larger than 992px.

#### Logo and Page Headings Gradient

The product has a basic logo at the moment, which still needs further
work as it was made purely for the purposes of this project. Work needs
to be done to make it stand out further.

#### Buttons

Each button offers a similar growing effect described above combined
with a change of its box shadow: it is black by default. The box shadow size decreases when the button is hovered over and the button's box shadow size decreases and increases on click, to give the user the impression that the button has been depressed. 

#### Navbar Hover effect

The navbar includes a hover-over effect to make the experience more
interactive and navigation more intuitive. When the user engages with
the link or hovers over the link, its background colour changes to Alice
Blue to subtly highlight the item without compromising legibility.


# Features

## Existing Features

Navigation bar

![navbar](/assets/readme/navbar.png)

Each page has a full responsive navigation bar at the top. It includes
the [Logo] (which is a link to the Home page) and the links to
Home and game pages. It retains an identical layout throughout the
website across all devices to ensure simple and intuitive navigation.
The Navbar will allow the user to reach any section of the website from
any point on the website without unnecessary steps and using browser
navigation buttons.

For mobile devices, it transforms into a compact \"hamburger menu\".
This dropdown menu features the same items, displayed as a column on a
semi-transparent background.

Sparkle Cursor Effect

![cursoreffect](/assets/readme/cursoreffect.png)

The sparkle cursor effect, which follows the user's movements, was designed to give a magical experience. It also reinforces the user's understanding that this is a game, particularly as it is designed for children.

Welcome Image

![welcomeimage](/assets/readme/welcomeimage.png)

This section is the first thing the user sees opening each page, it is
an eye-catching image for aesthetical stimulation, which also helps to
deliver the page's semantics as visual associations are commonly very
strong. On the Home page, the image gives the use a familiar image to
hook into, which uses their prior knowledge of the TV show to give them
context about how the game might function.

Rules section

![rulessection](/assets/readme/rulessection.png)

The ethos section will introduce the user to the concept of Pocket
Tutor, as it is slightly different to the usual way tutoring works. The
user will be introduced to the concept, given a little preview of the
benefits of signing up to Pocket Tutor and invited to learn more by
accessing the sign up page, which will book a call with the Sales Team.

Game Section

![game section](/assets/readme/gamesection.png)

Often, clients will choose in-person tutoring over online tutoring, this
section explains the benefits of choosing online tutoring. This was
deliberately presented as a video, as it reassures clients that there is
a human aspect to the service. By one of the tutors presenting the
benefits, potential clients are also reassured that the people working
with their children have the correct experience.

## Responsive layout

The site is designed to be flexible, fluid, responsive and aesthetically
enjoyable on all screen sizes and resolutions starting from 378px. To
ensure better performance on mobile devices, mobile versions (smaller in
size with different aspect ratios) most of the hero images are in a
smaller image format. It was considered necessary because the images
play a significant role in delivering the semantics of the website and
providing the intended user experience.

## Future Considerations

Additional pages will need to be created to house the code to allow
users to play the same game, based on other times tables.

Adaptions will need to be made to the code so that the random numbers
generated for the answer options is not replicated in the same question.

There is occasional interference on the hover effects caused by the cursor effect, where the highlighting colour flashes. Given more time to refine the site, this would be something to look into. 

Moving forward, it would improve the user experience if the levels of
the game were organised in a hierarchical manner, so that the user would
need to attain a certain score before the next level (times table) was
unlocked. This would increase the challenge and give users even more
reason to return to the game.

# Deployment

This project was hosted on Github. A repository was created by:

1. Navigate to Github.com and login.

2. On the left-hand sidebar, click the 'New' button.

3. Name the repository and click on the 'Create Repository' button.

During the creation of the project, the 'git add .', 'git commit
-m', 'git push' and 'git pull' commands were used.

This project was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as
follows:

1. Log into GitHub.

2. Select `milestone-project-2` from the list of repositories.

3. Select `Settings` From the Repositories sub-headings.

4. In the left side menu select `Pages`.

5. Click on the link labelled 'Visit Site' to go to the live
deployed page.

Due to issues with Codeanywhere during the creation of this project, I decided to move to use Replit as the cloud IDE. Due to this, the project was originally linked to a separate Github repo, which can be found at https://github.com/Mattjones444/TimesTablesTest.git
